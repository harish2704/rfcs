# Summary

Support TypeScript in Strapi.

# Example

```
npx create-strapi-app@beta my-app --ts
```

# Motivation

A large part of coders prefer to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript. This is the main motivation why we want to provide the possibility to support TypeScript in Strapi.

# Detailed design

The implementation of TypeScript support should be focused in a first phase on creating a project with TypeScript and in a second phase to convert an existing project from JavaScript to TypeScript
